This document contains the documentation for the software <<lar-running-demo>> (LRD). 

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
%% ==> Some hints are following:

\chapter{Purpose}\label{purpose}

LRD is a software that enables automatic model extraction from a set of medical images (like MRI). Such feature is achieved through a process in which a user gives input and other parameters to start the computation.

The whole software is based on the mathematical LAR framework\cite{dicarlo2013linear} and the OpenCL based framework OCLAR\cite{Furiani2013}.

\chapter{Using}\label{using}
The program consists of 3 bash scripts that can be used from a *NIX compatible shell:
\begin{itemize}
	\item \texttt{startConversion.sh}
	\item \texttt{startConversion-singleColor.sh}
	\item \texttt{visualize.sh}
\end{itemize}

Every script contains a \texttt{-h} option that can be used to discover the relevant options for each script as in \ref{lst:help-example}
\begin{lstlisting}[style=bash-style,label=lst:help-example]
# ./startConversion.sh -?
===================
LAR Model extractor
===================
Either run without args or with
To use args enable it with -u
-d <input images>       : Directory containing input images
-f <best image>         : Image to quantize on
-q <colors>             : Number of colors to quantize (min 2)
-c                      : Use OpenCL
\end{lstlisting}


\chapter{Some small hints}\label{hints}

\section{German Umlauts and other Language Specific Characters}\label{umlauts}
You can type german umlauts like 'ä', 'ö', or 'ü' directly in this file.
This is also true for other language specific characters like 'é', 'è' etc.

There are problems with automatic hyphenation when using language
specific characters and OT1-encoded fonts. In this case, use a
T1-encoded Type1-font like the Latin Modern font family (\verb#\usepackage{lmodern}#).


\section{References}\label{references}
Using the commands \verb#\label{name}# and \verb#\ref{name}# you are able
to use references in your document. Advantage: You do not need to think
about numerations, because \LaTeX\ is doing that for you.

For example, in section \ref{dividing} on page \pageref{dividing} hints for
dividing large documents are given.

Certainly, references do also work for tables, figures, formulas\ldots

Please notice, that \LaTeX\ usually needs more than one run (mostly 2) to
resolve those references correctly.


\section{Dividing Large Documents}\label{dividing}
You can divide your \LaTeX-Document into an arbitrary number of \TeX-Files
to avoid too big and therefore unhandy files (e.g. one file for every chapter).

For this, you insert in your main file (this one) for every subfile
the command '\verb#\input{subfile}#'. This leads to the same behavior
as if the content of the subfile would be at the place of the \verb#\input#-Command.
