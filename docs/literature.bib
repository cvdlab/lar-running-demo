  title = {Linear algebraic representation for topological structures},
  journal = {Computer-Aided Design},
  year = {2013},
  note = {Article in press},
  abstract = {With increased complexity of geometric data, topological models play
	an increasingly important role beyond boundary representations, assemblies,
	finite elements, image processing, and other traditional modeling
	applications. While many graph- and index-based data structures have
	been proposed, no standard representation has emerged as of now.
	Furthermore, such representations typically do not deal with representations
	of mappings and functions and do not scale to support parallel processing,
	open source, and client-based architectures. We advocate that a proper
	mathematical model for all topological structures is a (co)chain
	complex: a sequence of (co)chain spaces and (co)boundary mappings.
	This in turn implies all topological structures may be represented
	by a collection of sparse matrices. We propose a Linear Algebraic
	Representation (LAR) scheme for mod 2 (co)chain complexes using CSR
	matrices and show that it supports a variety of topological computations
	using standard matrix algebra, without any overhead in space or running
	time. A full open source implementation of LAR is available and is
	being used for a variety of applications.},
